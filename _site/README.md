Technicalities
- “Nav” (navigation) and “footer” uses float property.
- “About” and “FAQ” is styled like an accordion (CSS/JavaScript).
- “Home” and “Why FitBox” uses Flexbox (CSS).
- “Sneak Peak” uses responsive slideshow (see attributions).
- “Purchase”, “Log in”, “Register”, and “Contact/Support” uses forms (HTML/CSS) and form validation (PHP).
- “Social media”, “Terms”, and “Privacy” are mock pages generated by me or third party services (see attribution)
to demonstrate a “full” website.
- The header and background images are randomly chosen through 7 possible images with JavaScript
- All individual pages (as seen in root directory) are composed of parts, included with PHP or JavaScript.
- All components are ideally made to be responsive, through @media queries, viewport values and percentage
values.
- Website is uploaded at https://LxEmily.github.io/FitBox
- All files validated with 3rd party validators
- All images compressed with 3rd party compressors
- All links are text-based
- Colour scheme is black and white so the more colourful images and content can stand out
- Entire website is approximately 3MB
